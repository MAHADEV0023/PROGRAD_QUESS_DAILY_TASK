//Write a Java program for bonus calculation. Accept basic salary from user. Calculate TA = 10%, DA= 15%, HRA = 20%, PF= 12% of basic salary. If basic >= 20,000 then give 10% bonus otherwise give 20% bonus on basic salary. Calculate his gross (final) salary ( gross salary = Basic + DA + TA + HRA + Bonus â€“ PF)
